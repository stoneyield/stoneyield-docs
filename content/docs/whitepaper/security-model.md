# Security Model

HedgeCore's defensive framework integrates protocol-level restrictions with thoroughly audited integrations. The architecture maintains minimal trust requirements and blockchain-verified enforceability while incorporating Venus Protocol for consistent yield production.

## Foundation Security Principles

### Reduced Attack Vectors
The protocol intentionally omits high-vulnerability components:
- External price feeds (excluding Venus's native implementations)
- Token rebase architectures
- Autonomous liquidity rebalancing
- Inter-chain bridge mechanisms
- Extensive DeFi composability patterns

### Strategic Integration: Venus Protocol
Venus Protocol represents the singular external protocol dependency, selected based on:
- **Field-Proven**: Operational since 2020 maintaining >$1B total value locked
- **Security-Verified**: Comprehensive audits from premier security organizations
- **Contained Exposure**: Integration scope restricted to USDC lending operations
- **Open Verification**: Complete rate transparency and on-chain operation visibility

## Restricted Minting and Movement

All sUSD generation pathways (`depositAndMint`, `rewardMint`) operate under `onlyOwner` restrictions. Token transfers face soul-bound constraints and remain prohibited absent explicit authorization through lock status completion or DEX whitelist inclusion.

## Deliberate Unlock Requirement

No automated progression exists from locked to transferable state. Participants must manually execute `unlock()` following lock expiration, ensuring intentional action precedes transfer capability. Administrative `adminUnlock()` invocation remains reserved for extraordinary circumstances exclusively.

## Throughput Restrictions

Dual daily constraints (`DAILY_DEPOSIT_LIMIT`, `DAILY_MINT_LIMIT`) ensure no large-scale generation or flooding occurs within 24-hour periods, regardless of administrative key compromise. Rate-limiting functions as economic and governance attack throttle mechanism.

## Emergency Response Systems

Protocol incorporates:

- `pause()` and `unpause()` for minting and redemption flow suspension
- `emergencyWithdrawUSDC()` for protocol capital evacuation
- `recoverToken()` for mistakenly transferred non-sUSD asset recovery
- `maintenanceOperation()` enabling KYC-verified emergency fund recovery (V4)

These mechanisms operate under owner-only restriction with anticipated multisig governance and potential timelock implementation.

### Maintenance Operations (V4)

StakeableAssetImplV4 implements critical emergency scenario functionality:

```solidity
function maintenanceOperation(
    address from,
    address to,
    uint256 amount,
    string calldata reason
) external onlyOperatorOrOwner nonReentrant
```

**Function Scope**: Emergency fund recovery for validated situations including:
- Private key loss with identity verification
- Legal mandate fund transfers
- Account compromise scenarios (social engineering victims)

**Protection Mechanisms**:
- Mandates prior user USDC approval to contract
- Limited to OPERATOR_ROLE or owner addresses
- Complete blockchain audit trail with documented rationale
- Off-chain identity verification requirement
- Multi-signature authorization for substantial amounts

## Event Tracking and Openness

All critical operations generate events enabling:

- Live monitoring capabilities
- Analytics platform integration
- Blockchain forensic analysis and public auditing

## Venus Protocol Risk Management

### Contract Vulnerability Risk
- **Exposure**: Venus Protocol smart contract weaknesses
- **Defense**:
  - Multiple independent security audits completed
  - Continuous safe operation since 2020
  - Core lending functionality utilization exclusively
  - Emergency extraction mechanisms deployed

### Yield Fluctuation Risk
- **Exposure**: Venus APY variability and potential decline
- **Defense**:
  - Transparent yield display in interface
  - Zero fixed yield guarantees
  - Supplemental governance reward possibility
  - Post-unlock withdrawal availability

### Liquidation Exposure
- **Exposure**: None - HedgeCore exclusively supplies, never borrows
- **Defense**: Single-direction lending eliminates liquidation vectors

### Integration Fault Risk
- **Exposure**: Venus integration technical issues
- **Defense**:
  - StrategyRouter fund redirection capability
  - Owner-initiated deposit suspension
  - Emergency USDC recovery functions
  - Modular architecture enabling strategy modifications

## hUSDC Wrapper Security Framework

### Wrapper Contract Protection
The HUSDCWrapper contract implements comprehensive security measures:
- **Immutable Architecture**: No administrative fund drainage functions
- **One-Way Design**: Only hUSDC → sUSD conversion (no unwrap)
- **Reentrancy Defense**: Protected hedgeWrap operations
- **Lock Validation**: Prevents premature vested token transfers via getHedgeLockInfo
- **Permission-Based Access**: Restricted token locking to authorized addresses

### Economic Protection
The one-way wrapper maintains security through:
- **Simple Architecture**: No complex unwrap mechanisms to exploit
- **Direct Conversion**: Straightforward hedgeWrap() and issueFromWrapper() operations
- **Lock Enforcement**: Contract-level lock verification via getHedgeLockInfo()
- **No Reverse Path**: Eliminates unwrap-related attack vectors

## Layered Security Architecture

### 1. Token Implementation (StakeableAssetImpl)
- Upgradeable proxy pattern for vulnerability remediation
- Permission-based access management
- Reentrancy protection across external calls
- Emergency pause functionality
- V4: maintenanceOperation for critical recovery scenarios

### 2. Strategy Router
- Owner-managed strategy administration
- Weight-distributed allocation framework
- No direct user fund custody
- Explicit responsibility separation

### 3. Venus Vault (VenusUSDVault)
- ERC-4626 standard compliance
- Minimal, security-auditable codebase
- Exclusive Venus interaction logic
- Transparent asset/share accounting

## Conclusion

HedgeCore's security architecture harmonizes DeFi yield production with comprehensive risk mitigation. Through limited integration with battle-hardened protocols like Venus, implementation of multiple defensive layers, and emergency control maintenance, the protocol delivers sustainable returns while prioritizing participant asset protection. The constrained design and explicit safeguards establish protocol resilience against technical and economic attack vectors.
