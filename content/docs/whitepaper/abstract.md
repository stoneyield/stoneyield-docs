# Abstract

StoneYield is a decentralized yield platform on BNB Chain that issues soul-bound hedged tokens for secure capital deployment. At the center is STUSD, minted 1:1 from USDC and earning through Venus integration.

Wallet-level time locks and mandatory manual unlocks keep tokens immobile during staking. This stance neutralizes common DeFi vectors—flash loans, circular farming—and tightens alignment between users and their positions.

Yields flow transparently from Venus lending. The protocol retains a 7% fee; 93% goes to participants, enabling sustainable economics without emissions. Governance may authorize additional incentives via controlled minting.

To meet liquidity needs without sacrificing safety, StoneYield pairs STUSD with sUSDC, a transferable ERC20 wrapper around STUSD positions. This dual-token setup grants market access while the core stake keeps accruing. KYC-gated recovery paths add an extra protection layer.

StoneYield is a security-first staking stack that fuses soul-bound mechanics with proven yield routes, balancing capital preservation, durable returns, and liquid access via the sUSDC wrapper.
