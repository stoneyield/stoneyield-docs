# Flash-Loan Resistance

Flash loans represent a significant threat vector in DeFi, enabling attackers to borrow substantial token quantities without collateral and exploit vulnerable systems within single transactions. StoneYield maintains explicit engineering to mitigate such vulnerabilities through combined architectural and protocol-level determinations.

## No Transferability = No Exploitation

With STUSD non-transferable while locked, tokens cannot be shuttled mid-transaction. Flash-loan playbooks that need rapid movement for arbitrage, recursive borrowing, or liquidity mining simply have nothing to work with.

## Lock Validation

All STUSD generated through deposits or reward allocations undergoes duration-based lock. Throughout the lock period:
- Transfers remain disabled unless the address receives explicit unlock
- Approvals face restriction unless engaging with whitelisted DEXs or the participant maintains unlocked status
- Tokens cannot move or liquidate in bulk within a flash loan timeframe

## Deliberate Unlock Requirement

The mandate to invoke `unlock()` following lock expiry introduces manual gate between holding and transferring. This ensures that regardless of time lock expiration, tokens maintain non-transferability until the participant takes action, effectively preventing automated scripts from exploiting unlock windows.

## Protocol-Level Throttling

StoneYield utilizes global daily constraints to prevent large-scale manipulation:
- `DAILY_DEPOSIT_LIMIT`: caps USDC inflows per day
- `DAILY_MINT_LIMIT`: caps STUSD issuance per day

This assists in reducing coordinated attack risk involving high-volume generation, such as recursive strategies or treasury drainage via flash loans.

## External Call Defense

Critical functions like `depositAndMint()` and `rewardMint()` receive protection with `ReentrancyGuard` and `nonReentrant` modifiers to prevent nested calls and reentrancy exploits. Additionally, the protocol's capacity to `pause()` operations provides multisig owners time to respond in extreme scenarios.

## Summary

A blend of non-transferability, explicit unlocks, daily caps, and reentrancy guards gives StoneYield native flash-loan resistance. The protocol locks down the core primitive—token movement—so attacks can’t get off the ground.
