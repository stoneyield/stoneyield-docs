# How It Works

## Soul-Bound Token Flow

STUSD is minted soul-bound and stays tied to the origin wallet:
- Transfers and trading are disabled by design
- Discourages speculation and keeps focus on hedging
- Long-dated locks reinforce program discipline
- Rewards map cleanly to the wallets that earned them

## Flash-Loan Resilience

The stack is shaped to blunt flash-loan style exploits:
- Borrow/return loops can’t influence accounting paths
- Yield pools can’t be manipulated mid-block
- Participant rewards stay consistent under stress

## Real Yield Pipeline

Returns come from verifiable sources, not emissions:
- On-chain reward mints under protocol control
- Accrued protocol fees and partner revenue
- No synthetic APY or inflation-based rewards
- Auditable distribution math

## Defense in Depth

Risk controls are layered:
- Third-party security reviews on contracts
- Multisig-led treasury management
- Time-locked upgrades where applicable
- Emergency pause/circuit-breakers ready

## Open Operations

State is observable end to end:
- Live TVL, rewards, and reserve visibility
- Transparent fee routing and income reporting
- Governance logic kept in the open
