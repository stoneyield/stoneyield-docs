# How It Works

## Soul-Bound Token Architecture

sUSD tokens maintain non-transferability and permanent binding to their minting wallet:
- Transfer and trading capabilities disabled
- Eliminates speculative trading behaviors
- Reinforces long-duration hedging commitment
- Enables precise and equitable reward attribution

## Flash-Loan Defense

Architected to neutralize flash loan-based exploitation patterns:
- No borrow-return cycles can compromise the system
- Protects protocol yield pools from manipulation vectors
- Secures integrity of participant reward allocations

## Sustainable Yield Production

Yield generation operates through genuine, non-inflationary mechanisms:
- Yield distributes via on-chain reward minting functions under protocol control
- Accumulated protocol fees
- Strategic integrations and collaborative partnerships
- Zero token emissions or artificial APY constructions
- Transparent, auditable reward architecture

## Security-First Design

Constructed with layered security model to minimize risk exposure:
- Smart contracts undergo independent security audits
- Treasury administration via multisig protocols
- Upgrade mechanisms incorporate time-lock constraints
- Emergency circuit breaker capabilities available

## Transparent Protocol Operations

All economic and technical operations maintain public verifiability:
- Real-time data on TVL, yield distribution, and reserve status
- Clear tracking of protocol revenue and fee allocation
- Open governance logic implementation
