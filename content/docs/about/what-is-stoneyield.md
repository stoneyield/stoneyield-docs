# What is StoneYield?

StoneYield is a hedging network on BNB Chain that blends institutional-grade guardrails with DeFi composability. It mints **sUSDC**, a soul-bound claim on hedged deposits, and allocates it across curated strategies. When portability is needed, the position can be wrapped 1:1 into **STUSD**, a transferable twin backed by the original sUSDC.

## sUSDC: The Soul-Bound Core

Every USDC deposit mints sUSDC straight to the depositor:

- **Locked to wallet** – non-transferable, closing off flash-loan/sandwich angles.
- **Predictable unlocks** – preset lock menus (7 / 30 / 90 days) secure strategies.
- **Direct yield** – harvested APY credits the holding wallet.

## STUSD: Portable Liquidity

Desks can wrap sUSDC into STUSD at parity via the wrapper:

- **DeFi/DEX ready** – works across AMMs and lending rails.
- **Fully backed** – each STUSD maps to its underlying sUSDC.
- **Zero disruption** – unwrap snaps back to the protected position.

## Operating Flow

1. Deposit USDC into StoneYield.
2. Get soul-bound sUSDC while capital runs through hedged strategies.
3. Wrap to STUSD when liquidity is needed.
4. Receive 93%+ of harvested APY (protocol retains a small ops fee).
5. Request unlocks based on your selected schedule.

## Architecture Pillars

- **Security-first**: multisig controls, mint throttles, audited code.
- **Transparency**: live metrics, unlock timelines, wallet KPIs.
- **Composability**: STUSD moves broadly; sUSDC quarantines risk.

## Why BSC?

BNB Chain offers low fees, fast finality, and direct access to the venues backing our hedging and lending flows.
